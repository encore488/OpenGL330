# OpenGL330
Introduction

  Did the Grand Canyon make you yawn? Was Niagara Falls not majestic enough for you? Are you so overstimulated that you're numb to all beauty? Boy, do I have the thing for you!
  
  Introducing the next great wonder of the world, OpenGL330! It is a simulated alternative world that is full of complex objects from the real world. It's like the Matrix, minus Neo and Agent Smith.
  
  There are several shaders built to hand rendering tasks off to the GPU. There are functions that create a series of vertices, then link them together into a bunch of triangles, which are handed to the shaders, then turned into graphics in a little pop up window.

How To Use

  To build the latest version: Method 1: Download Visual Studio and go to the folder labeled "OpenGLSample" at the top of this repo. In there, you'll find a "OpenGLSample.vcxproj". Once you get that to run, you might want to check that the Source.cpp is up to date by looking at when it was updated here.
  
  Method 2: Find the most recent zip file, which at the time of this writing is CS330Mod6OpenGL.zip. Download that and Visual Studio. You will have to open that file in Visual Studio, then configure the file to be able to run OpenGL and glfw. Instructions for that are here: https://learn.snhu.edu/content/enforced/1374826-CS-330-R1888-OL-TRAD-UG.23EW1/course_documents/CS%20330%20Module%20One%20Setup%20Guide.pdf?_&d2lSessionVal=qb2YjBlAndTu7mpLfhlmHDgs3&ou=1374826  and here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFESEn0ZdLg&feature=youtu.be 
  
  Once you get that to run, you should go to the most recent update of Source.cpp (and any other files that have been updated or added since the last zip)
  
  To see how it was built: Download the zip files, starting with the oldest. Throughout the project, almost all of the code I am responsible for remained in Source.cpp, so you can just look at that file and figure out how to run with the above instructions.
