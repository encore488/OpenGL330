# OpenGL330
Introduction

  Did the Grand Canyon make you yawn? Was Niagara Falls not majestic enough for you? Are you so overstimulated that you're numb to all beauty? Boy, do I have the thing for you!
  
  Introducing the next great wonder of the world, OpenGL330! It is a simulated alternative world that is full of complex objects from the real world. It's like the Matrix, minus Neo and Agent Smith.
  
  There are several shaders built to hand rendering tasks off to the GPU. There are functions that create a series of vertices, then link them together into a bunch of triangles, which are handed to the shaders, then turned into graphics in a little pop up window.

How To Use

  To build the latest version: Method 1: Download Visual Studio and go to the folder labeled "OpenGLSample" at the top of this repo. In there, you'll find a "OpenGLSample.vcxproj". Once you get that to run, you might want to check that the Source.cpp is up to date by looking at when it was updated here.
  
  Method 2: Find the most recent zip file, which at the time of this writing is CS330Mod6OpenGL.zip. Download that and Visual Studio. You will have to open that file in Visual Studio, then configure the file to be able to run OpenGL and glfw. Instructions for that are here: https://learn.snhu.edu/content/enforced/1374826-CS-330-R1888-OL-TRAD-UG.23EW1/course_documents/CS%20330%20Module%20One%20Setup%20Guide.pdf?_&d2lSessionVal=qb2YjBlAndTu7mpLfhlmHDgs3&ou=1374826  and here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFESEn0ZdLg&feature=youtu.be 
  
  Once you get that to run, you should go to the most recent update of Source.cpp (and any other files that have been updated or added since the last zip)
  
  To see how it was built: Download the zip files, starting with the oldest. Throughout the project, almost all of the code I am responsible for remained in Source.cpp, so you can just look at that file and figure out how to run with the above instructions.


How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by writing out the requirements on a piece of paper. Then, I write some really basic pseudocode to fulfill those requirements. Then I try to implement that. Then, I check that all my goals have been met. Finally, I write comments and clean things up a bit. In the future, I might want to get a little more explicit with my pseudocode. I also may want to explain things to a rubber ducky before I write anything down.

How do I approach developing programs?
At first, I approached this program as an incremental process, where I slowly add a little more and a little more functionality each week. Eventually I trashed that idea because old development was constantly in the way of new development. I had to rebuild several times because I couldn't figure out how to tack on new functions without drastically altering everything I had already done.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My current goal in life is to utilize technology (especially computer vision) to reduce environmental damages. Computer vision is considered a field of computer science, so I guess the answer is something like "Building recycling robots", or "Fine tuning a YOLO program to better distinguish between plastic bags and jellyfish."
Another goal I have is to make money and try to have fun while doing it. I suppose it would be pretty fun to work on a graphics or game engine, and it might be a nice way to start my career, even if it's not directly related to my environmental goals. If I do spend some time working on a graphics engine, my newfound knowledge will be very helpful.
